## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Additional content

Below is the additional content used to provide more information on cars data
Please make sure the "ggplot2" package is installed, using "install.packages(\"ggplot2\')

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```
